## What are the recent changes made to Termux?

All Termux repositories previously hosted on JFrog Bintray are down since `1st May 2021`. It means that all
repositories hosted on `dl.bintray.com` domain are no longer available anymore. It is due to the recent withdrawal of
the Bintray hosting service by JFrog (more about
that [here](https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/)).


> F-Droid houses the latest stable versions of Termux that are now **not released** on the Play Store. It is the reason that we should have the latest version from F-Droid installed.

#### Okay, but what is **F-Droid** you ask?

F-Droid is an installable catalog of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform. In
In simpler terms, F-Droid is like the Play Store for open-sourced applications for Android.

#### Is it safe?

F-Droid is entirely open-sourced and has millions of eyes monitoring the source code of the apps submitted. It
has strict compliance for the app submissions, and a zero-tolerance for Google APIs.

If you haven't installed Termux via the F-Droid client or via directly downloading their APK file and installing it,
the chances are that you're still running the Google Play Store version. In that case, follow the instruction below.

* Uninstall the present installation of Termux

> This will remove all the distros and other data related to Termux that you might have but is a necessary step in order to avoid version conflict. If you want to back up your data, please follow [this guide](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux)

1. Visit https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/ and download the APK of the latest version of Termux. Alternatively, you can also download and install the F-Droid client to help you manage future updates and other stuff.

    <alert type="warning">Android might give you a warning that files like these might harm your device; you can safely ignore that. That is a generic warning triggered whenever you download an executable or installable file from elsewhere than the Google Play Store.</alert>

   
2. Once you've downloaded the APK, the next step is to **Allow installation from Unknown Sources**.

3. Click on the downloaded file, and you might see a popup like the one shown below:

    _If you don't see this warning, please skip to the next step_ but if you do, follow along.

    Click on the **Settings** options of the popup and **turn on** the radio button as shown below.

    Hit back a few times until you see this dialog shown below.
