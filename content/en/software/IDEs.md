We love to code here and Andronix is a portable computer. Why not use it to code anywhere? You can use full-fledged IDEs
inside Andronix.

<alert type="warning">We have only tested VS code, IntelliJ Idea, IntelliJ DataGrip, MonoDevelop (tested GTKsharp, ASP
NET, ASP NETCORE this last have a problem with the target framework), Mono (In console, you can compile simple console
programs in C #) Net Core. You can test other IDEs and edit this page to add it to the list.</alert>

## IntelliJ Idea

Here are the steps needed to install IntelliJ Idea on your Andronix instance

<alert type="info">This assumes that you have the SDK for your language already installed for the distro you are
using.</alert>

* Download the latest tar.gz file from JetBrains
  official [download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux).
* After downloading the tar.gz, make sure that it is in your download folder and after run the following command.
  Change `x` to the name of the tar downloaded.

```bash
tar -xzf ideaIU-2xxx.x.x.tar.gz -C ~/Desktop/
```

* The tar should now be unzipped in `Desktop/ideaIU-2xxx.x.x`, where 'x' stands for the year and version number.
* Now choose the command from below and run it inside Linux terminal

### Debian/ Ubuntu/ Kali Linux

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
