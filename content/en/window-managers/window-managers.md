According to the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager) for Window Managers, here's what they stand for:

> A window manager is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface.[1] Most window managers are designed to help provide a desktop environment. They work in conjunction with the underlying graphical system that provides required functionalityâ€”support for graphics hardware, pointing devices, and a keyboard, and are often written and created using a widget toolkit.

In simpler terms, a **window manager is a program that deals with placing, removing and basically just managing the placement of window**.

## Which WM should I choose?


You can pick whichever WM you like, or you are familiar with but for the most part we recommend going forward with a [Desktop Environment](../desktop-enviroments) if you're new to Andronix. Operating WM without an actually keyboard can be unpleasant. That being said if you're ready to explore, pick up **Awesome**.
